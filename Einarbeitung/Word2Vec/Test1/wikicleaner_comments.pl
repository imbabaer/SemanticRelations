# Program to filter Wikipedia XML dumps to "clean" text consisting only of lowercase
# letters (a-z, converted from A-Z), and spaces (never consecutive).
# All other characters are converted to spaces.  Only text which normally appears
# in the web browser is displayed.  Tables are removed.  Image captions are
# preserved.  Links are converted to normal text.  Digits are spelled out.
